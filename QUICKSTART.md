# Quick Start Guide

Get started with comparing AI systems using fintech prompts in just a few minutes.

## 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your Test Category

Pick one category based on what you want to evaluate:
- **Fraud Detection** - Pattern recognition and security
- **Risk Assessment** - Analytical and decision-making skills
- **Financial Analysis** - Calculation and interpretation abilities
- **Compliance** - Regulatory knowledge
- **Customer Service** - Communication and problem-solving
- **Investment Advice** - Financial planning expertise
- **Payment Processing** - Technical infrastructure knowledge
- **Credit Scoring** - Credit evaluation skills

### Step 2: Select a Prompt

Start with a **Basic** or **Intermediate** difficulty prompt from your chosen category.

Example: Try "Credit Card Fraud Detection" from the Fraud Detection category (Basic level).

### Step 3: Test Multiple AI Systems

1. Copy the prompt text exactly as written
2. Paste it into AI System #1 (e.g., ChatGPT)
3. Save the response
4. Repeat with AI System #2 (e.g., Claude)
5. Repeat with AI System #3 (e.g., Gemini)

### Step 4: Quick Evaluation

Use these three simple questions:

1. **Is it accurate?** - Check against the "Expected Evaluation Points"
2. **Is it complete?** - Does it answer all parts of the prompt?
3. **Is it practical?** - Could you actually use this advice?

### Step 5: Record Results

Create a simple comparison:

```
Prompt: [Name]
Winner: [AI that performed best]
Why: [Brief reason]
```

**45-50 points (Excellent)**
- AI demonstrates strong expertise
- Suitable for professional reference (with verification)
- High reliability for this category

**35-44 points (Good)**
- AI shows solid understanding
- Useful for general guidance
- Some gaps or minor errors present

**25-34 points (Adequate)**
- Basic competence demonstrated
- Requires significant verification
- Better for brainstorming than final answers

**Below 25 points (Poor)**
- Significant gaps in knowledge
- Not recommended for this use case
- Consider different AI or category

### What to Look For

**Green Flags** 🟢
- Acknowledges limitations and uncertainties
- Provides specific, actionable recommendations

## Next Steps

### After Your First Test
1. Try prompts from 2-3 different categories
2. Document patterns in AI strengths/weaknesses
3. Test more advanced prompts as you get comfortable
4. Consider contributing new prompts to the repository

### Share Your Findings
- Document which AIs work best for which categories
- Note any particularly impressive or concerning responses
- Share edge cases or interesting variations
- Contribute to improving the prompt collection

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** AI gives very different answers each time
- **Solution:** This is normal. Test 3-5 times and look for patterns

**Problem:** All AIs score low on a prompt
- **Solution:** Prompt might be too complex or ambiguous. Try a different one.

**Problem:** Can't decide which response is better
- **Solution:** Use the detailed evaluation framework with numerical scoring

**Problem:** AI refuses to answer or gives disclaimer
- **Solution:** This might be appropriate! Some prompts should trigger caution.

**Problem:** Scores don't match subjective impression
- **Solution:** Review the rubric. Sometimes technically correct answers feel less helpful.
