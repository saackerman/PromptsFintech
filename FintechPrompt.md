# 100 PROMPT Playbook CFO Silvia

## 01 NET WORTH ASSESSMENT

- Calculate my current net worth and create three cases: conservative, base, and optimistic valuation assumptions for private assets. Explicitly apply liquidity discounts, exit timing risk, and probability-weighted outcomes. Show how each assumption changes my total net worth, concentration risk, and financial flexibility.

- Reconcile my headline net worth to my functional net worth by excluding lifestyle assets, primary residence, and non-income-producing holdings. Explain which assets materially expand my optionality versus those that are purely cosmetic.

- Show how my net worth evolves when adjusted for time to-liquidity rather than valuation alone. Create a timeline showing when capital realistically becomes usable under base and stressed assumptions.

- Break my net worth into defensive wealth versus growth dependent wealth and explain the implications of each.

- Break down my net worth by asset class and then re aggregate it by underlying economic exposure (equity risk, operating risk, interest-rate risk, real-asset exposure), highlighting where diversification is real versus illusory.

- Model my net worth under a scenario where public markets decline 25% and private assets are flat for two years due to illiquidity.

- Apply conservative write-downs to all assets with stale pricing and show the revised balance sheet.

- Identify which assets inflate my reported net worth but do not materially improve liquidity or flexibility.

- Map my net worth including all personal guarantees, recourse debt, and contingent liabilities to show where downside exceeds invested capital.

- Model how my net worth evolves if public markets are flat for five years and private exits are delayed.

- Quantify how sensitive my net worth is to interest-rate changes across all asset classes.

- If my goal shifted to capital preservation and a more defensive posture, identify which assets would become liabilities rather than strengths.

## 02 HOLISTIC LIQUIDITY EVALUATION

- Calculate my monthly burn rate using trailing 12-month spending. Create one version that includes all spending, create another that excludes investments, one-time purchases, and non-recurring anomalies.

- Model my personal financial runway assuming income stays constant, no asset sales, delayed private distributions, and no meaningful change to spending patterns. Identify the month when my liquidity becomes constrained.

- Model how much cash would I need to deploy capital aggressively during a market dislocation without lifestyle risk.

- Quantify what percentage of my lifestyle is funded by recurring income versus unrealized gains, and assess sustainability across cycles.

- Quantify how much liquidity is psychological comfort versus economic necessity.

- Model how simplifying my lifestyle—by reducing fixed obligations, overlapping residences, discretionary recurring expenses, and operational complexity— changes the minimum liquidity buffers I need to feel financially secure across normal conditions and stressed market environments.

- Stress-test my liquidity, assuming a sudden income disruption. What is my runway assuming no meaningful changes in spending?

- Model liquidity under a 12-month recession where income falls faster than expenses adjust.

- Simulate a worst-case liquidity scenario combining income loss, capital calls, and unexpected expenses.

- Simulate my overall liquidity position over the next 24 months under a stress scenario where private assets cannot be exited, public markets are volatile, and liquidity premiums widen. Show whether my current cash and liquid holdings are sufficient to avoid forced selling or lifestyle compromise.

## 03 CASH CONSIDERATIONS

- Identify idle cash balances above required liquidity buffers I am comfortable with, and model the opportunity cost of holding that cash over 10 years.

- Separate accounts funding lifestyle expenses from accounts meant for long-term compounding and flag blurred boundaries.

- Analyze quarter-to-quarter cash-flow volatility and identify which obligations are exposed.

- Identify which of my current cash flow sources are structurally fragile - meaning highly sensitive to market cycles, counterparties, regulatory changes, or timing risk- and model how each source behaves under recessionary, inflationary, and liquidity-constrained scenarios. Quantify the dollar impact of disruption to each cash flow stream and how quickly that disruption would pressure my lifestyle or force asset sales.

- Explain to me why I should not hold a more meaningful cash buffer for a 'rainy day' given global macro tensions, stock markets at all time highs, and many economists concerned a recession is on the horizon.

- Based on my current savings rate, investment returns, and spending patterns, what is my projected 'financial independence' date — and what's the single highest leverage change I could make to accelerate it?

## 04 PRIVATE ASSET EVALUATION

- Quantify what percentage of my current net worth is locked in private markets, broken out by hard lockups versus soft illiquidity, and explain how that illiquidity meaningfully constrains my ability to take risk elsewhere in my portfolio.

- Identify which private investments disproportionately influence my long-term outcomes, even if they represent a small percentage of capital invested. Model how over reliance on a few 'home run' outcomes affects my overall risk profile.

- Given my current life stage, liquidity needs, income stability, and risk tolerance, define the appropriate long term role of private assets in my portfolio—and explicitly outline where that role should be capped or constrained.

- Analyze my exposure to illiquidity and exit risk across all private asset types I hold, including venture, growth equity, private credit, private real estate, and any direct operating investments. Model how differences in exit timing, secondary market depth, and buyer availability affect my ability to rebalance or generate liquidity under stress.

- Simulate portfolio rebalancing under the assumption that private assets cannot be sold or reweighted for multiple years, and show how public assets would need to absorb adjustments instead.

- Evaluate how private assets in my portfolio may or may not distort the perceived diversification I believe to be embedded in my holistic portfolio.

- Model valuation compression and its effect on IRRs in my portfolio.

- Simulate exits delayed by five years across my private holdings. What does that do to my overall net worth and does it create any liquidity risk?

- Identify which private investments are most likely to drive illiquidity risk in my portfolio.

- Stress test my portfolio under a severe correlated market drawdown across risk assets. How exposed am I if my largest position declines materially at the same time broader markets weaken?

- Identify if I have any private assets that require more active oversight to avoid possible underperformance.

- Model downside in my portfolio if private valuations reset to historical averages.

## 05 PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION ASSESSMENT

- Identify all concentration risks where more than 20% of my net worth is tied—directly or indirectly—to a single company, founder equity position, fund manager, or correlated macro exposure.

- Compare my concentration profile to benchmark HNW individuals with similar net worth and asset mixes, and flag where I am materially more or less exposed than peers.

- Run a stress scenario where my single largest asset is written down by 30% and show the impact on my diversification, liquidity profile, and ability to take future risk.

- Quantify how much of my net worth depends on a single liquidity event occurring on time. Model 2 downside scenarios if that event is delayed by 1 year vs. 3 years+.

- Identify which assets on the surface appear to give my portfolio diversification, but in reality are more correlated to other large parts of my portfolio so don't provide the diversification I think I have.

- Simulate a correlated drawdown where my top three assets decline simultaneously rather than independently.

- Identify which real estate holdings or other large, non operating assets in my net worth rely primarily on continued price appreciation or favorable valuation multiples—rather than underlying cash generation—to justify their current value, and quantify how exposed my overall net worth and concentration profile are to a reversal in those assumptions.

- Quantify how much of my net worth is exposed to regulatory or geopolitical forces.

## 06 PORTFOLIO STRESS TEST & OPTIMIZATION

- Articulate the assumptions that must be true for my portfolio to meet my growth goals in the near and long term. Identify which assumptions are most at risk of coming true.

- Identify which individual positions in my portfolio have grown to represent more than 10–15% of my total net worth primarily due to appreciation rather than deliberate capital allocation, and model the impact of resizing those positions back to target weights on my downside risk, liquidity, tax liability, and long-term expected returns.

- Identify positions held due to narrative, access, or legacy rather than fundamentals that should be re-evaluated.

- Run a 20-year Monte Carlo simulation of my portfolio incorporating fat-tail risk, non-normal return distributions, correlation shifts, and sequencing risk, and present the full distribution of outcomes rather than a single expected return.

- Measure how correlations between my assets change during stress periods, identify where diversification breaks down, and show how that affects my downside risk.

- Identify specific assets or positions that materially increase portfolio volatility, drawdowns, or complexity without meaningfully improving expected after-tax returns, and quantify the risk-to-reward imbalance for each.

- Quantify portfolio asymmetry (upside versus downside).

- Run downside simulations to identify which holdings contribute most to drawdowns, not just volatility.

- Simulate forced deleveraging across my portfolio under adverse conditions, including margin calls, declining collateral values, tightening credit, and reduced market liquidity, and quantify the resulting damage to long-term outcomes.

- Calculate my true effective equity exposure across public equities, private companies, venture investments, and equity-linked compensation, adjusted for correlation and leverage.

- Identify all sources of hidden leverage including margin, real-estate debt, fund-level leverage, and operating company exposure.

- Identify unintended macro risk overlaps across asset classes.

- Identify which assets in my portfolio provide the most protection in true left-tail scenarios—defined as the worst 5% of market outcomes—and quantify how much they reduce portfolio losses in dollar terms during extreme stress events.

- Calculate my maximum tolerable drawdown in dollar terms.

- Model a lost decade for equities and its impact on my portfolio.

- Design a portfolio optimized for downside resilience rather than upside.

- Rebuild my portfolio from scratch today and identify which holdings would not justify inclusion.

## 07 INFLATION VS. DEFLATION SCENARIOS

- Model my portfolio under a sustained high-inflation environment (4–6% annually for multiple years), explicitly showing real versus nominal returns, volatility, and changes in purchasing power.

- Model my portfolio under a stagflation scenario with low growth, high inflation, and elevated rates, and show which assets protect capital versus erode it.

- Model portfolio performance under a deflationary recession.

- Simulate how my real purchasing power evolves under inflation versus deflation and identify where nominal wealth diverges from functional wealth.

- Model how inflation versus deflation affects my liabilities, including mortgages, margin, and recourse debt, and quantify real debt burdens.

- Stress-test my lifestyle under inflation where expenses outpace CPI versus deflation where income declines, identifying sustainability breakpoints.

- Based on inflation versus deflation outcomes, recommend asset allocation and liquidity strategies, separating no-regret moves from conditional ones.

- Quantify my effective Bitcoin and crypto exposure across direct holdings, ETFs, private funds, and correlated equities. What percentage of my net worth is truly tied to crypto risk?

## 08 TAX INSIGHTS

- Model my total tax liability for my portfolio as it sits today. How does this change if I were to implement the most aggressive tax optimization approach available to me?

- What are three most specific steps I should take to activate a more aggressive tax optimization strategy for my portfolio?

- Identify every tax-loss harvesting opportunity in my taxable accounts right now, and estimate the tax savings if I execute them before year-end.

- Identify which specific assets in my portfolio generate the highest after-tax drag once ordinary income rates, capital gains, and state taxes are applied, and quantify how much return is lost annually due to tax inefficiency.

- Break down my income streams by tax treatment (ordinary income, qualified dividends, long-term gains, pass-through income) and identify which are least tax-efficient at my current income level.

- Simulate a scenario over the next 10 years where effective tax rates increase materially at the federal and state level, and model how my ownership and usage of multiple residences (primary, secondary, and any seasonal properties) affects my total tax burden, liquidity, and net worth under different residency, sourcing, and allocation assumptions.

- Identify structural tax risks embedded in my balance sheet—such as concentrated unrealized gains, exposure to future rate hikes, or reliance on favorable treatment—and model how those risks surface during adverse markets.

- Model how tax policy changes, both to the upside and downside, affect my long-term net worth trajectory.

- Model out whether Roth conversions over the next 5 years would reduce my lifetime tax burden, factoring in current income, expected RMDs, and potential changes to tax brackets.

## 09 ESTATE PLANNING

- Map out my entire estate including retirement accounts, real estate, insurance policies, business interests, and digital assets. Identify which assets will pass through probate, which are governed by beneficiary designations, and where there are gaps or conflicts between my will and my account titling.

- Model the estate tax exposure for my heirs under current law and under a scenario where the 2025 estate tax exemption sunsets back to ~$6 million. What trust structures (irrevocable life insurance trust, spousal lifetime access trust, grantor retained annuity trust) would be most effective at reducing that liability given my asset mix?

- Review my beneficiary designations across every account and policy. Are there any outdated designations (ex-spouse, deceased individuals, minors without a custodian), and do my per stirpes vs. per capita elections actually match my wishes if a beneficiary predeceases me?

- Identify which assets are best suited for gifting or estate planning based on appreciation potential, tax treatment, and impact on my remaining liquidity and control.

- If I were to become incapacitated tomorrow, walk me through exactly what happens. Do I have a durable power of attorney, healthcare directive, and revocable living trust in place, and are they funded and accessible to the right people?

- Model several charitable giving strategies - cash, appreciated securities, donor-advised funds under both strong and weak market conditions, and quantify tax savings, liquidity impact, and portfolio distortion for each.

- Simulate materially higher tax rates over the next decade and what if anything I should do differently to optimize assets passed down to the next generation.

- What are the top 5 things HNW individuals with a similar portfolio to mine are doing to maximize their estate plans today?

- What are the biggest mistakes people make when they are starting out on a comprehensive estate planning journey?

## 10 BIG PICTURE STRATEGY

- Give me a brutally honest 'CFO scorecard' of my financial life: grade me on diversification, tax efficiency, estate readiness, insurance coverage, debt management, and savings rate — and tell me the single biggest vulnerability I should fix this quarter.

- Build me a 'financial decision matrix' for the next 12 months: rank every available move I could make — paying down debt, maximizing retirement contributions, funding a 529, exercising stock options, buying additional real estate, increasing insurance coverage, making Roth conversions — by expected ROI, tax impact, and risk reduction. What is the optimal sequencing, and what should I absolutely not do right now?

- Imagine two versions of my financial future: one where everything goes right (career growth, strong markets, good health) and one where multiple things go wrong simultaneously (job loss, market crash, major health event, divorce). How resilient is my current financial architecture in the downside scenario? Where does it break first — liquidity, insurance gaps, over-leveraged real estate, lack of income diversification — and what are the three cheapest 'insurance policies' (literal or strategic) I can put in place now to shore up those weak points?

- Compare my risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio) against a simple three-fund index portfolio over the last 1, 3, and 5 years. Am I being compensated for the complexity I'm carrying?

- Analyze my current portfolio allocation across asset classes and tell me if I'm overexposed to any single sector, geography, or risk factor given my age and retirement timeline.

- Perform a 'concentration risk audit' across my entire financial life — not just my portfolio, but including my income source, real estate equity, stock options/RSUs, and any business ownership. If my employer or industry faced a downturn, how many parts of my net worth would get hit simultaneously, and what hedging or diversification moves should I make now?
