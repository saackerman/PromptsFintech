## 01. Net Worth Assessment

- "Calculate my current net worth and create three cases: conservative, base, and optimistic valuation assumptions for private assets. Explicitly apply liquidity discounts, exit timing risk, and probability-weighted outcomes. Show how each assumption changes my total net worth, concentration risk, and financial flexibility."
- "Reconcile my headline net worth to my functional net worth by excluding lifestyle assets, primary residence, and non-income-producing holdings. Explain which assets materially expand my optionality versus those that are purely cosmetic."
- "Show how my net worth evolves when adjusted for time-to-liquidity rather than valuation alone. Create a timeline showing when capital realistically becomes usable under base and stressed assumptions."
- "Break my net worth into defensive wealth versus growth-dependent wealth and explain the implications of each."
- "Break down my net worth by asset class and then re-aggregate it by underlying economic exposure (equity risk, operating risk, interest-rate risk, real-asset exposure), highlighting where diversification is real versus illusory."
- "Model my net worth under a scenario where public markets decline 25% and private assets are flat for two years due to illiquidity."
- "Apply conservative write-downs to all assets with stale pricing and show the revised balance sheet."
- "Identify which assets inflate my reported net worth but do not materially improve liquidity or flexibility."
- "Map my net worth including all personal guarantees, recourse debt, and contingent liabilities to show where downside exceeds invested capital."
- "Model how my net worth evolves if public markets are flat for five years and private exits are delayed."
- "Quantify how sensitive my net worth is to interest-rate changes across all asset classes."
- "If my goal shifted to capital preservation and a more defensive posture, identify which assets would become liabilities rather than strengths."

## 02. Holistic Liquidity Evaluation

- "Calculate my monthly burn rate using trailing 12-month spending. Create one version that includes all spending, and another that excludes investments, one-time purchases, and non-recurring anomalies."
- "Model my personal financial runway assuming income stays constant, no asset sales, delayed private distributions, and no meaningful change to spending patterns. Identify the month when my liquidity becomes constrained."
- "Model how much cash would I need to deploy capital aggressively during a market dislocation without lifestyle risk."
- "Quantify what percentage of my lifestyle is funded by recurring income versus unrealized gains, and assess sustainability across cycles."
- "Quantify how much liquidity is psychological comfort versus economic necessity."
- "Model how simplifying my lifestyle—by reducing fixed obligations, overlapping residences, discretionary recurring expenses, and operational complexity—changes the minimum liquidity buffers I need to feel financially secure across normal conditions and stressed market environments."
- "Stress-test my liquidity, assuming a sudden income disruption. What is my runway assuming no meaningful changes in spending?"
- "Model liquidity under a 12-month recession where income falls faster than expenses adjust."
- "Simulate a worst-case liquidity scenario combining income loss, capital calls, and unexpected expenses."
- "Simulate my overall liquidity position over the next 24 months under a stress scenario where private assets cannot be exited, public markets are volatile, and liquidity premiums widen. Show whether my current cash and liquid holdings are sufficient to avoid forced selling or lifestyle compromise."

## 03. Cash Considerations

- "Identify idle cash balances above required liquidity buffers I am comfortable with, and model the opportunity cost of holding that cash over 10 years."
- "Separate accounts funding lifestyle expenses from accounts meant for long-term compounding and flag blurred boundaries."
- "Analyze quarter-to-quarter cash-flow volatility and identify which obligations are exposed."
- "Identify which of my current cash flow sources are structurally fragile… and model how each source behaves under recessionary, inflationary, and liquidity-constrained scenarios."
- "Explain to me why I should not hold a more meaningful cash buffer for a ‘rainy day’ given global macro tensions, stock markets at all time highs, and many economists concerned a recession is on the horizon."
- "Based on my current savings rate, investment returns, and spending patterns, what is my projected ‘financial independence’ date — and what’s the single highest-leverage change I could make to accelerate it?"
