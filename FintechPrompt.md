# Fintech Prompt Playbook

## 01 NET WORTH ASSESSMENT
- Calculate my current net worth and create three cases: 
conservative, base, and optimistic valuation 
assumptions for private assets. Explicitly apply liquidity 
discounts, exit timing risk, and probability-weighted 
outcomes. Show how each assumption changes my total 
net worth, concentration risk, and financial flexibility.
- Reconcile my headline net worth to my functional net 
worth by excluding lifestyle assets, primary residence, 
and non-income-producing holdings. Explain which 
assets materially expand my optionality versus those 
that are purely cosmetic.
- Show how my net worth evolves when adjusted for time
to-liquidity rather than valuation alone. Create a timeline 
showing when capital realistically becomes usable under 
base and stressed assumptions.
- Break my net worth into defensive wealth versus growth
dependent wealth and explain the implications of each.
Break down my net worth by asset class and then re
aggregate it by underlying economic exposure (equity 
risk, operating risk, interest-rate risk, real-asset 
exposure), highlighting where diversification is real 
versus illusory.
- Model my net worth under a scenario where public 
markets decline 25% and private assets are flat for two 
years due to illiquidity.
- Apply conservative write-downs to all assets with stale 
pricing and show the revised balance sheet.
Identify which assets inflate my reported net worth but 
do not materially improve liquidity or flexibility.
Map my net worth including all personal guarantees, 
recourse debt, and contingent liabilities to show where 
downside exceeds invested capital.
- Model how my net worth evolves if public markets are 
flat for five years and private exits are delayed.
Quantify how sensitive my net worth is to interest-rate 
changes across all asset classes.
- If my goal shifted to capital preservation and a more 
defensive posture, identify which assets would become 
liabilities rather than strengths.

## 02 HOLISTIC LIQUIDITY EVALUATION
- Calculate my monthly burn rate using trailing 12-month 
spending. Create one version that includes all spending, 
create another that excludes investments, one-time 
purchases, and non-recurring anomalies.
Model my personal financial runway assuming income 
stays constant, no asset sales, delayed private 
distributions, and no meaningful change to spending 
patterns. Identify the month when my liquidity becomes 
constrained.
- Model how much cash would I need to deploy capital 
aggressively during a market dislocation without lifestyle 
risk.
- Quantify what percentage of my lifestyle is funded by 
recurring income versus unrealized gains, and assess 
sustainability across cycles.
- Quantify how much liquidity is psychological comfort 
versus economic necessity.
- Model how simplifying my lifestyle—by reducing fixed 
obligations, overlapping residences, discretionary 
recurring expenses, and operational complexity—
changes the minimum liquidity buffers I need to feel 
financially secure across normal conditions and stressed 
market environments.
- Stress-test my liquidity, assuming a sudden income 
disruption. What is my runway assuming no meaningful 
changes in spending?
- Model liquidity under a 12-month recession where 
income falls faster than expenses adjust.
- Simulate a worst-case liquidity scenario combining 
income loss, capital calls, and unexpected expenses.
- Simulate my overall liquidity position over the next 24 
months under a stress scenario where private assets 
cannot be exited, public markets are volatile, and 
liquidity premiums widen.
- Show whether my current 
cash and liquid holdings are sufficient to avoid forced 
selling or lifestyle compromise

## 05 PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION ASSESSMEN
- Identify all concentration risks where more than 20% of 
my net worth is tied—directly or indirectly—to a single 
company, founder equity position, fund manager, or 
correlated macro exposure.
- Compare my concentration profile to benchmark HNW 
individuals with similar net worth and asset mixes, and 
flag where I am materially more or less exposed than 
peers.
- Run a stress scenario where my single largest asset is 
written down by 30% and show the impact on my 
diversification, liquidity profile, and ability to take 
future risk.
- Quantify how much of my net worth depends on a single 
liquidity event occurring on time. Model 2 downside 
scenarios if that event is delayed by 1 year vs. 3 years+.
Identify which assets on the surface appear to give my 
portfolio diversification, but in reality are more 
correlated to other large parts of my portfolio so don't 
provide the diversification I think I have.
Simulate a correlated drawdown where my top three 
assets decline simultaneously rather than independently.
- Identify which real estate holdings or other large, non
operating assets in my net worth rely primarily on 
continued price appreciation or favorable valuation 
multiples—rather than underlying cash generation—to 
justify their current value, and quantify how exposed my 
overall net worth and concentration profile are to a 
reversal in those assumptions.
- Quantify how much of my net worth is exposed to 
regulatory or geopolitical forces.
