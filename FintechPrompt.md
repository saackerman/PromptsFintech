## 05 PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION 
ASSESSMENT
- Identify all concentration risks where more than 20% of 
my net worth is tied—directly or indirectly—to a single 
company, founder equity position, fund manager, or 
correlated macro exposure.
- Compare my concentration profile to benchmark HNW 
individuals with similar net worth and asset mixes, and 
flag where I am materially more or less exposed than 
peers.
- Run a stress scenario where my single largest asset is 
written down by 30% and show the impact on my 
diversification, liquidity profile, and ability to take 
future risk.
- Quantify how much of my net worth depends on a single 
liquidity event occurring on time. Model 2 downside 
scenarios if that event is delayed by 1 year vs. 3 years+.
Identify which assets on the surface appear to give my 
portfolio diversification, but in reality are more 
correlated to other large parts of my portfolio so don't 
provide the diversification I think I have.
Simulate a correlated drawdown where my top three 
assets decline simultaneously rather than independently.
- Identify which real estate holdings or other large, non
operating assets in my net worth rely primarily on 
continued price appreciation or favorable valuation 
multiples—rather than underlying cash generation—to 
justify their current value, and quantify how exposed my 
overall net worth and concentration profile are to a 
reversal in those assumptions.
- Quantify how much of my net worth is exposed to 
regulatory or geopolitical forces.
